# Blockly for Thymio with Arabic support

This is a fork of [@mobsya-association/node-blockly](https://github.com/Mobsya/blockly) holding [the latest commit as of the forking date](https://github.com/Mobsya/blockly/tree/d06475a6d7bf6d326c08778a87844ab5423842bd), the aim of it is to allow mobsya blockly to support Arabic language.

The [@mobsya-association/node-blockly](https://github.com/Mobsya/blockly) is itself a fork of Google's Blockly that adds blocks to control the Thymio robot. It also provides an AESL code generator that converts visual programs using these blocks to the Aseba language.

**Note:** This repository is best suited as a git submodule for [node-blockly project](https://github.com/hahouari/node-blockly), consider developping on the latter rather on this one.
